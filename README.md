## Diffusion Laboratory Description

Source: http://physics.wustl.edu/classinfo/360/Pdf/expDescription.pdf

Diffusion plays an important role in many processes in biology.  The physical mechanism 

underlying diffusion is random displacement due to collisions occurring on a molecular scale, also 

known as Brownian motion or random walk.  In this lab you will explore the mathematics of 

random walks using simple models and Matlab-based computer simulations.
