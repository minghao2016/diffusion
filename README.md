## Diffusion Laboratory Description

Source: http://physics.wustl.edu/classinfo/360/Pdf/expDescription.pdf

> Diffusion plays an important role in many processes in biology.  The physical mechanism underlying diffusion is random displacement due to collisions occurring on a molecular scale, also known as Brownian motion or random walk.  In this lab you will explore the mathematics of random walks using simple models and Matlab-based computer simulations.

## DLA.matlab	

Two-dimensional diffusion limited aggregation simulation. Particles are initialized on an outer rectangular boundary with a corresponding rectangular kill zone. This simulation was a starting point for our DLA simulations, but was found to produce a mass density inconsistent with literature values for 2-dimensional DLA. Due to the rectanular creation radius, the simulation showed a bias away from the creation rectangular's corners.
